### Project Overview

The primary objective of this project was to leverage **Business Analytics** to evaluate the effectiveness, employee perception, and cost-benefit analysis of the various employee welfare schemes offered by ONGC. The analysis aims to provide data-driven insights to optimize resource allocation and enhance employee satisfaction and retention.

* **Period:** Summer 2025
* **Methodology:** Quantitative analysis of a primary employee survey (N=400) combined with qualitative feedback interpretation.
* **Key Focus Areas:** Participation Rates, Performance & Productivity Correlation, Attrition Risk Assessment, and Cost-Benefit Perception.

### Key Findings & Insights

Based on the analysis of 400 employee responses, the following key insights were drawn:

* **Attrition Influence:** Approximately **49%** of respondents reported considering leaving ONGC, with **52%** of that group stating welfare schemes *did not* influence them to stay, indicating a high-risk band.
* **Scheme Usage:** **Housing** and **Medical** facilities were identified as the most frequently availed schemes.
* **Productivity Correlation:** A positive correlation was found between the perception of welfare scheme access and self-assessed job performance/productivity.
* **Top Suggested Improvements:** Employees frequently suggested enhancements in **medical facilities**, **upgrading housing**, and **implementing digital portals** for scheme management.
